    "# Introduction\n",
    "Numerous mountain edifices on Mars have been identified using spacecraft imagery and topographic information that bear a strong resemblance to terrestrial glaciovolcanic analogs. Notably, the Dorsa Argentea Formation in the southern polar region of Mars contains multiple putative glaciovolcanic edifices initially mapped by Tanaka and Scott for the USGS in 1987, later identified as candidate subglacial volcanoes by Ghatan and Head in 2002. Building off of the rich understanding of glaciovolcanic processes on Earth, a careful analysis of glaciovolcanic processes on Mars may allow us to more accurately interpret past environmental conditions and reconstruct the Martian paleoclimate. The growing number of observations of glaciovolcanic landforms on Mars allows for the prediction of global distributions of ice throughout Mars's history, and the spatial and temporal distribution of glaciovolcanic edifices can provide key constraints on the paleo-climate, ice-sheet extent, and water inventory for Mars. \n",

    "In this paper I present a review morphology and mineralogy of candidate glaciovolcanic edifices in the Sisyphi Planum region of Mars of suggested glaciovolcanic origin, and I seek to answer questions such as: What defining evidence is there for the presence of glaciovolcanism in the Southern highlands of Mars? What limitations do we encounter when investigating glaciovolcanic processes on other planetary bodies? How can we best characterize glaciovolcanic landforms using remote-sensed observations?\n",

    "The first section of this paper contains a brief review of glaciovolcanism on Earth. Then, I present a review of observations and evidence for glaciovolcanism in the Dorsa Argentea Formation in the southern hemisphere of Mars. In the following sections I discuss the limitations of a characterizing glaciovolcanic landforms on other planetary bodies which are implicit to the remotely-sensed observations that are presently available. Finally, I will review the future work that needs to be done to more rigorously constrain and characterize glaciovolcanic edifices on other planetary bodies. \n",

    "# Glaciovolcanism on Earth\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Glaciovolcanism is defined as encompassing all interactions between magma and ice in it's varying forms (e.g. ice, snow/firn, and meltwater) that occur subglacially (under ice), supraglacially (above ice), and proximally (i.e. ice-impoundment/contact) (Smellie, 2007).  Glaciovolcanic landforms are intrinsically modulated by their contact with ice and meltwater, and therefore encode important paleoenvironmental information, e.g. the distribution and thickness of ice sheets and englacial lakes over time (Russell, 2014). Because observations and sampling are generally only accessible after the volcanic edifice passes above the impounding ice, subglacial eruptions themselves are relatively poorly understood compared to subaerial and subaqueous eruptions. Thus, developing an understanding of glaciovolcanic processes relies heavily on sound interpretations of edifice morphology and lithofacies classification. Russell et al. (2014) suggests that glaciovolcanic edifices, or 'tuyas',  to be 'positive-relief volcanoes having a morphology resulting from ice confinement during eruption (and not e.g. erosion), comprised of a set of lithofacies that are formed via the direct interaction of magma and ice/water'. This classification scheme allows for a straightforwards characterization of glaciovolcanic edifices based on their morphology and lithofacies and will be referenced for the remainder of this paper. The next two sections present a review of the morphometric and lithofacies characterization of tuyas.\n",

    "### Lithofacies characterization of glaciovolcanic edifices\n",
    "#### Lithofacies structure\n",
    "Tuyas with similar morphologies may by distinct in their lithofacies assemblages (e.g. pillow dominated vs. tephra-dominated flat-topped tuya) which can arise from the eruptive style (e.g. explosive vs effusive) and interaction of between magmas and ice/water. Descriptive lithofacies modifiers can therefore be combined with edifice-scale morphologies to further constrain glaciovolcanic origins of a tuya. Magma composition is also used to further characterize tuyas (e.g. basaltic, andesitic, rhyolitic, etc.). Importantly, most of these lithofacies are diagnostic of subaqueous eruption only and do not necessarily require glaciation. It is thus important to collect observations relating to characteristics of the surrounding environment in order to correctly differentiate between glaciovolcanic and non-glaciovolcanic subaqueous eruption. For example, a massive pillow lava deposit proximal background evidence of glacial landforms can indicate glaciovolcanic, rather than submarine, origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different glacio-hydrological regimes combined with volcanic eruptive style are expected to produce distinct lithofacies styles as shown in Figure XXXX (Russell et al., 2014). Thus, coherent interpretation of glaciovolcanic lithofacies allows insight into magmatic parameters (e.g. magma viscosity, volatile content), eruptive style (explosive vs effusive), glacio-hydrologic conditions, e,.g. thickness of ice coverage, drainage networks, magma to water ratio, etc. (Smellie and Skilling 1994, Smellie et al., 2011). Figure XXXX shows a summary from Russell et al. (2014) of nine model tuyas which form under varying distinct glacio-hydrological condition and eruptive styles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cold-based glacial environments with very thick ice coverage create conditions where meltwater likely remains trapped and creates forms an englacial lake proximal to the vent. Erupted magma is rapidly quenched, producing pillow lavas and breccias, quench fragmented hyaloclastites in effusive cases, subaqeous tephra (pyroclasts formed via magmatic, phreatomagmatic, and quench fragmentation) in the case of explosive eruption. If the volcanic edifice does not breach the englacial lake during the eruptive phase either by exceeding water level by growth or drainage of the englacial lake, it is expected that a passage zone does not develop and that a conical tuya will result. Thus, the height of edifices which formed in these glacio-hydrological conditions can only provide constraints on the minimum elevation of the englacial lake and the minimum thickness of the enclosing ice sheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "If ice thickness is sufficiently thin and meltwater drainage is more rapid (e.g. wet based glaciers), a passage zone is created when the tuya breaches the surface of the englacial lake and enters into a subaerial eruptive regime (Jones and Nelson, 1970). Importantly, the eruptive style determines the morphology of the passage zone. If the eruptive style is or becomes explosive upon breaching the surface of the lake, a pyroclastic passage zone is created (Russell, 2013), demarcated by a transition between sub-aqueous tephra to subaerial tephra in the case of continually explosive eruption, or a transition between subaqueous pillow lavas and tephra to sub-aerial tephra. Both these explosive-explosive and effusive-explosive conditions are expected to form tephra cones rather than flat-topped tuyas and thus are difficult to differentiate from morphology alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under well drained conditions, e.g. thin wet-based/temperate glacial ice (Smellie and Skilling, 1994), or topography is steep and conducive to drainage (Kelman et al., 2002b) glacial meltwater is able to drain relatively rapidly and the dominant volcanic lithofacies are expected to be subaerial massive lavas or subaerial tephra depending on an effusive or explosive eruption style, respectively. Impoundment of massive lavas flows by the enclosing glacial ice prevents extensive lateral spreading of lava flows and produces a characteristically overthickened stacked sequences of lavas. Thus, effusive eruptions (whether initially effusive or transitionally explosive to effusive) are expected to produce steep-sized flat topped tuyas. Russell et al. (2014) posit that well-drained systems are more likely to be found close to well developped drainage networks that are often found near the edges of ice sheets. Thus, the spatial distribution of flat-topped tuyas characterized by well-drained glacio-hydrological settings could indicate the limits of ancient ice sheets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lithofacies mineralogy\n",
    "Depending on the volcanic alteration regimes, glaciovolcanism can create distinct mineral assemblages. Subglacial hydrothermal systems, subglacial weathering, subaerial hydrothermal systems, and subaerial weathering are all expected to produce relatively distinct alteration mineral assemblages. Mineralogy produced during glaciovolcanic eruptions is affected by the quenching process of magma cooling rapidly against ice or water, which forms basaltic glass (sideromelane), later followed by in situ subglacial or subaqueous hydrothermal alteration of the sideromelane. \n",
    "\n",
    "Glaciovolcanic hydrothermal alteration has been studied in British Columbia, Hawaii, and Iceland. Samples from BC [Jercinovic et al., 1990] show that subglacial eruptions are associated with the in-situ (authigenic) mineralization of clay minerals and zeolites. In Hawaii and Iceland, Pleistocene glaciovolcanic deposits are observed to contain smectites, hematite, sideromelane and zeolites [Golden et al., 1993, Bishop et al., 2002b] and numerous studies in Iceland show that in situ glaciovolcanic deposits also contain sulfates (gypsum, jarosite) and iron oxides [Warner and Farmer, 2010]. The collective mineral assemblage which forms from the hydrothermal alteration of sideromelane is referred to as palagonite. The formation of palagonite requires the presence of basaltic glass, low temperatures, and a high water to rock ratio, all of which are satisfied in subglacial or submarine volcanic settings. Subglacial chemical weathering is suggested to be determined mainly by bedrock composition, and alteration products tend to be silica-dominated, hydrated and poorly crystalline [Rampe et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2017]. It follows then that silica content of subglacial meltwaters is higher for mafic rocks containing more soluble silicates (e.g. olivine and pyroxene) and decreases for felsic rocks containing less soluble quartz and feldspars [McLennan et al., 2003]. Sulfate precipitates (e.g. gypsum) are also observed in proglacial zones in Svalbard (Norway), hypothesized to have formed via the transport of soluble chemical weathering products away from the glacial systems  [Szynkiewicz et al., 2013]. Subaerial weathering is highly dependent on the climate and duration of alteration, however phyllosilicates like smectite and kaolinate are commonly found in soils formed in volcanic environments [Singer, 1980]\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the spectral analysis commonly applied in planetary science, Ackiss et al. (2019) hypothesize that spectral signatures would be dominated by a few key phases depending on the environment as follows:  Zeolites and smectites spectrally dominate subglacial hydrothermalvolcanic regions [Swayze et al., 2002], silica spectrally dominates subglacial weathering environments [Scudder et al., 2017], clay minerals spectrally dominate subaerial hydrothermal volcanic regions [Ehlmann et al., 2012], and smectites and kaolinite dominate subaerial weathering environments [Delvaux et al., 1989; Alexander et al., 1993]. Spectral identification of key mineral assemblages can therefore be used to identify the volcanic alteration regime of a given region of interest. Since similar mineral assemblages are produced by glaciovolcanism and submarine volcanism, the glacio-hydrologic setting during time of eruption must be inferred from the lithofacies morphologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Morphological characterization of glaciovolcanic edifices \n",
    "Characterization of glaciovolcanic edifices is concerned mainly with the 'primary' morphologies of the edifices rather than post-eruption modifications (i.e. erosion). These morphologies include “tuyas” or table mountains that are steep sided and flat topped edifices and “tindars” or ridges that are flat-topped and linear (both of which are flat-topped due to sub-aerial lava flows erupting after the edifice breaches the ice sheet). Alternatively, conical subglacial mounds are produced when the erupting edifice does not breach the ice-sheet or englacial lake. Russell et at. (2014) places all glaciovolcanoes into one of four categories of tuya: i) flat-topped (old term: stapei, tuya), ii) conical (mounds), iii) linear (hryggir, moberg, ridge, tindar), and iv) complex. Linear tuyas are distinguised from conical and flat-topped tuyas with a length to width aspect ratio greater than 2:1 (Jakobsson and Gudmundsson, 2008). Complex tuyas are simply described as morphologically or stratigraphically complicated volcanic edifices resulting from a diverse history of eruptive style and generally result in a morphology resembling some combination of the other three (e.g. generally flat topped linear tuyas also including a subaerial tephra cones). \n",
    "\n",
    "Many morphometric parameters can be used to classify volcanic edifices. For example, flank slope of terrestrial volcanoes can be used to differentiate volcanic types, whether shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, cinder cones, or subglacial volcanoes. Typical slopes from Rossi (1996) for shield volcanoes is up to 5 degrees, between 10-30 degrees for stratovolcanoes, ~30 degrees for cinder cones, and greater than 30 degrees for subglacial volcanoes. It is important to note, as emphasized by Kleinhans et al. (2011) that angle of repose is modulated by the surface gravity field, and thus these slope classifications do not necessarily map cleanly to other planetary bodies. Other morphometric parameters commonly used include edifice height, basal length and width, volume, and aspect ratio (Smellie, 2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "As elucidated above, tuya morphology can encode information about the glacio-hydrological conditions during eruption. Notably, the passage zone boundary where eruption transitions from subaqueous to subaerial provides important contraints on the height of the englacial lake and the minimum ice sheet thickness (Russell et al., 2014).  As increasing number of digital elevation models (DEMs) become available, past studies have attempted to systematically characterize the morphometry of volcanic edifices using DEMs.\n",

    "# Glaciovolcanism on Mars\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Under modern cold and hyper-arid conditions (mean temperature of ~215 K and mean surface pressure of 6.1 mbar at the equator), surface ice is largely confined to polar regions and summer daytime temperatures exceed the frost point and most latitudes. However, there is ubiquitous evidence for a water-rich / ice-rich crust at mid to high latitudes provided by the presence of elevated rampart and 'pedestal' craters . There is no clear consensus on whether the paleoclimate of Noachian Mars prior to 3.7 Ga was 'warm and wet' or 'cold and icy'. The presence of valley networks, deltas, lake deposits, and minerals formed in aqueous environments indicate a past presence of liquid water. Paleoclimate models have also converge to similar 'cold and icy' solutions where snow and ice is deposited in the southern highlands, and which do not allow for liquid water to be stable on the surface. Melting of the glaciated regions produces liquid water which flow down-gradient towards a state of hydrostatic equilibrium, carving valley networks and forming lake deposits, deltas, and other geohydrologic landforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Glaciovolcanism implicitly requires periods of glaciation and volcanism to coincide boths spatially and temporally. This condition has been shown to be plausibly met by prior studies [de Vet (2013); Neukum et al. (2010)]. In the region of interest of this paper, the Dorsa Argentea Formation, regional glaciation and volcanism is theorized to have taken place during the late Noachain to late Hesperian periods, about 3.8-3.2 billion years ago [Cousins and Crawford (2011)]\n",

    "## Sisyphi Montes\n",
    "### Geography & Geology\n",
    "Sisyphi Montes are a group of over 100 mountain edifices within Sisyphi Planum, located within the Dorsa Argentea Formation. Figure XXXX shows a global topographic map of Mars which highlights the Sisyphi Planum region. The Dorsa Argentea Formation is a high latitude, middle Hesperian-aged circumpolar unit in the southern Hemisphere of Mars, confined to within about 9000km of the south pole. The Dorsa Argentea Formation and surrounding Noachian-Hesperian units are extensive volatile-rich units thought to be the remains of the former southern ice sheet, with a total surface area about twice as large as the current south polar cap [Head and Pratt, 2001]. Picardi et al. (2004) found that radar detections of subsurface ice using MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding) are strongly correlated with the Dorsa Argentea Formation. These results suggest the presence of remnant subsurface ice within the Dorsa Argentea Formation, the composition of which has not been confirmed but is assumed to be a mix of water or CO2 ice asd chlathrates (Wordsworth et al., 2013). The Dorsa Argentea Formation also hosts a variety of geomorphology consistent with those of glacial origin, such as pitted landforms, sinous ridges, and lobate plains units (e.g. Tanaka and Scott, 1987; Ghatan and Head, 2002; Wordworth et al., 2013). \n",

    "Sisyphi Montes is comprised of over 100 mountain edifices that share morphologically  similar styles as tuyas on Earth. Initially, Sisyphi Montes was mapped as 17 mountains of unknown origin within the Dorsa Argentea Formation (Tanaka and Scott, 1987). The mountains are additionally characterized by broad summit areas and low height to width aspect ratios. This geometry lends itself to generally low angle flank slopes (less than 10 degrees) however, on average, the flank slopes tend to be steeper than for other volcanic (non-glaciovolcanic) martian edifices. Ghatan and Head (2002) later expanded the number of edifices to 22 and considered possible origins, including impact cratering, volcanism and tectonic processes. The morphologies of the edifices was found to be inconsistent with impact cratering morphologies or rootless cones. The authors hypothesized that the edifices were likely of volcanic origin on account of their steep flank slopes and flat tops, erupting under a Hesperian aged ice sheet. Using data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimer (MOLA) Ackiss et al. (2019) later expanded the number of edifices in Sisyphi Montes to 106. Past studies have classified these mountains into three main morphological groups: i) low domes, ii) flat-topped, and iii) cone shaped. The majority of cone shaped mountain fall near the center of the Dorsa Argentea Formation where the former ice sheet is expected to have been the thickest. These cone shaped edifices are interpreted as glaciovolcanic pyroclastic cones, however given that the majority of these morphologies are not unique to glaciovolcanic origin, the only morphologic class which exhibits uniquely glaciovolcanic morphologies are flat-topped tuyas (Ackiss, 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Sisyphi Montes are generally flat-topped with steep sided edifices (Ghatan and Head, 2002), consistent with classic terrestrial tuya morphologies (Russell et al., 2014). Summit elevations of the candidate subglacial volcanoes tends to be between 500-2200m above their bases, and basal diameters range between 20 and 70km. Many of the mountains are enclosed in roughly circular basins 50-300 metres deep that extend roughly to one mountain-diameter. The enclosing basins tend to lack sharp, raised rims and instead grade gently back to the level of surrounding plains. Additionally, many of the enclosing basins show clear sinous channels extending towards low topography, potentially representing massive meltwater channels formed by glacial outwash events (jökulhlaups). Possible mechanisms for the formation of these encircling depressions include subsidence due to base-up melting of the Dorsa Argentea Formation induced by enhanced geothermal heat flux from the volcano (Ghatan and Head, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuya Lithofacies \n",
    "#### Mineralogy:\n",
    "Recent surveys of the southern high latitudes show that hydrated sulfates and other hydrated phases of unknown composition are widspread but the strongest on the Sisyphi Montes. Chemical signatures from the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer (GRS) and visible/near-infrared spectral surveys from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) exhibit strong signatures consistent with hydrated sulfates (e.g. Ackiss and Wray, 2014), olivine, and pyroxene (). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ackiss et al. (2018) examined the mineral assemblages on five tuyas in Sisyphi Montes using 11 images from CRISM, a hyperspectral visible/near-infrared imaging spectrometer on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. This analysis revealed three distinct spectral classes: i) gypsum-dominated, ii) polyhydrated-sulfates (or zeolite), iii) a smectite-zeolite-iron oxide mixture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The gypsum dominated spectrum has strong detections on only one edifices analyzed here. Gypsum dominated spectra show exhibit absorption bands in the V-NIR wavelengths at 0.52, 0.91, 1.2, 1.43, 1.92, 2.22 and 2.47 $\\mu m$. Absorption lines in the near-infrared indicate the presence of water (Clark et al., 1990) and are uniquely consistent with laboratory spectra of gypsum (Ackiss et al., 2018). The 1.9 $\\mu m$ spectral signature in the near-infrared is expected to dominate the spectral signal of a 5% wt. gypsum-basalt mixture (Howari et al., 2002; Cloutis et al., 2008, Horgan et al., 2009). Absorption lines in the visible bands show a variety of Fe-oxide minerals (e.g. lepidocrocite, goethite, akeganeite). Association of iron-oxides and sulfates has been observed in other mineral assemblages on Mars (Bibring et al., 2007). On Earth, gypsum (and other sulfates) are found in subglacial and subaerial volcanic environments as mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitive identification of palagonite on Mars is a indicative of subaqueous and/or subglacial volcanism rather than just the low-temperature weathering of basalt. Combining remotely-sensed mineralogical observations with a detailed morphological analysis of the region presents a strong case for a subglacial hydrothermal environment in the Sisyphi Montes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure:\n",
    "Limited image resolution in the Sisyphi Montes region limits the possibility of a qualitative review of the lithofacies structures of the glaciovolcanic edifices in question. Complete characterization of the Sisyphi Montes tuyas is thus difficult if not presently impossible: positive identification of larger scale features such as pillow lavas, columnar jointing, tephra deposits, and lava flows has not been done in the past. On a finer spatial scale, there is presently no clear method for discerning lithofacies which are diagnostic of the glacio-hydrological conditions as outlined in section 3. (e.g. dipping breccias, subaerial vs subaqueous tephra).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Elsewhere on Mars, there is hopeful evidence for the preservation and observability of volcanic lithofacies required to characterize the volcanic histories of edifices. For example, imagery of the flank scarp of Olympus Mons show steeply dipping lithofacies which extend away from the edifice. Initial observations using the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) suggested the presence of steeply dipping lava flows, but newer observations using the High Resolution Science Imaging Experiment (HiRISE) show that these lithofacies are highly jointed and of volcanic origin. Elsewhere, putative glaciovolcanic edifices in the Northern lowlands of Chryse and Acidalia Planitia appear to be steeply dipping with horizontal layering (Martínez-Alonso et al., 2011), but limited resolution prevents the positive identification of evidence diagnostic of a volcanic origin (such as pillow lavas or columnar jointing) is also lacking. \n",

    "# Discussion & future work\n",
    "Morphological observations of candidate tuyas in the Sisyphi Montes provide promising evidence for glaciovolcanic origin of these edifices. The original intent of this paper was to provide a holistic characterization of candidate glaciovolcanic edifices in the Sisyphi Montes region that is up to date and consistent with terrestrial classification schemes. Here, we have conducted a review of primary and secondary literature and considered glaciovolcanic classification schemes for tuyas based on geometry and critical lithofacies diagnostic of characteristic of glaciovolcanic eruption environments. While in terrestrial studies, combined morphological and lithofacies criteria have been used to  identify fundamentally different glaciohydraulic conditions, additional lithofacies observations are essential to strengthen the interpretation of putative glaciovolcanic edifices on Mars. The implications of this lack of qualitative lithofacies observations means that glacio-hydrological history of these edifices is limited to interpretations of mineralogy and morphology. Paleo-reconstruction of past ice sheet thickness and englacial lake heights is thus restricted to morphological interpretation via the identification of passage zones from shape, topography and imagery.  While the combination of remotely-sensed mineralogical observations with a detailed morphological analysis of the region presents a strong case for a subglacial hydrothermal environment in the Sisyphi Montes,  without clear lithofacies characterizations this area of research seems to have reached an impass.\n",
    "\n",
    "High resolution imagery and more detailed spectral surveys of the Sisyphi Montes region are paramount to further characterize the lithofacies of Sisyphi Montes. Terrestrial studies have shown that LiDAR-derived surface roughness texture mapping is well suited for identifying and describing pristine and eroded volcanic deposits, since geomorphic units have unique roughness textures that can be used to differentiate distinct materials (Whelley et al, 2014). At present, the spatial resolution of LiDAR derived surface topography is too coarse to implement such an analysis. Thus, more detailed surveys and analyses using topographic data may be able to further characterize the lithofacies in question, using derived features such as surface roughness. The most rigorous solution to fully characterizing the constituent lithofacies of Sisyphi Montes is to obtain ground-truth data, requiring rover-based field study of the region including detailed mineralogical analysis and clear classification of units. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper I have attempted to answer the questions: What do we need to be able to properly identify glaciovolcanic landforms in planetary science? What are we missing? What story can we actually tell using the observations that we have? What additional observations are needed to close this loop? How can we improve? \n"
